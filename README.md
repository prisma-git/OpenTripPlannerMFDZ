## Overview

OpenTripPlanner (OTP) is an open source multi-modal trip planner, focusing on travel by scheduled
public transportation in combination with bicycling, walking, and mobility services including bike
share and ride hailing. Its server component runs on any platform with a Java virtual machine (
including Linux, Mac, and Windows). It exposes REST and GraphQL APIs that can be accessed by various
clients including open source Javascript components and native mobile applications. It builds its
representation of the transportation network from open data in open standard file formats (primarily
GTFS and OpenStreetMap). It applies real-time updates and alerts with immediate visibility to
clients, finding itineraries that account for disruptions and service changes.

Note that this branch contains **OpenTripPlanner 2**, the second major version of OTP, which has
been under development since Q2 2018 and was released as version v2.0.0 in November 2020.

If you do not want to test or explore this version, please switch to the final 1.x release
tag `v1.5.0` or the `dev-1.x` branch for any patches and bugfixes applied to the v1.5.0 release.

## Performance Test

[ðŸ“Š Dashboard](https://otp-performance.leonard.io/) 

We run a speed test (included in the code) to measure the performance for every PR merged into OTP. 

[More information about how to set up and run it.](./test/performance/README.md)

## Repository layout

The main Java server code is in `src/main/`. OTP also includes a Javascript client based on the
Leaflet mapping library in `src/client/`. This client is now primarily used for testing, with most
major deployments building custom clients from reusable components. The Maven build produces a
unified ("shaded") JAR file at `target/otp-VERSION.jar` containing all necessary code and
dependencies to run OpenTripPlanner.

Additional information and instructions are available in
the [main documentation](http://docs.opentripplanner.org/en/dev-2.x/), including a
[quick introduction](http://docs.opentripplanner.org/en/dev-2.x/Basic-Tutorial/).

## Development

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/branch/dev-2.x/graph/badge.svg?token=ak4PbIKgZ1)](https://codecov.io/gh/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner)

OpenTripPlanner is a collaborative project incorporating code, translation, and documentation from
contributors around the world. We welcome new contributions.
Further [development guidelines](http://docs.opentripplanner.org/en/latest/Developers-Guide/) can be
found in the documentation.

### Development history

The OpenTripPlanner project was launched by Portland, Oregon's transport agency
TriMet (http://trimet.org/) in July of 2009. As of this writing in Q3 2020, it has been in
development for over ten years. See the main documentation for an overview
of [OTP history](http://docs.opentripplanner.org/en/dev-2.x/History/) and a list
of [cities and regions using OTP](http://docs.opentripplanner.org/en/dev-2.x/Deployments/) around
the world.

## Mailing Lists

The main forums through which the OpenTripPlanner community organizes development and provides
mutual assistance are our two Google discussion groups. Changes and extensions to OTP are debated on
the [opentripplanner-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opentripplanner-dev) developers'
list. More general questions and announcements of interest to non-developer OTP users should be
directed to
the [opentripplanner-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opentripplanner-users) list.
Other details of [project governance](http://docs.opentripplanner.org/en/dev-2.x/Governance/) can be
found in the main documentation.

## MFDZ's OpenTripPlanner fork

This repo contains the Java code of OTP as well as a Dockerfile that is automatically deployed.

### Docker image

The image is [deployed to Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mfdz/opentripplanner).

#### Automatic graph download

If you want the container to download a zip file containing the graph (`graph.obj`) and 
the runtime configuration files (`otp-config.json`, `router-config.json`), use the following command:

```
docker pull mfdz/opentripplanner:latest
docker run --rm -it \ 
    -e GRAPH_ZIP_URL=https://example.com/graph.zip \
    -p 8080:8080 \
    mfdz/opentripplanner:latest
```

Then visit https://localhost:8080 to view the debug UI.

#### Manual mode

If you want to use a volume to place the graph and config files, you should use the following command:

```
docker pull mfdz/opentripplanner:latest
docker run --rm -it \ 
    -v /place/on/host/graph/:/opt/opentripplanner/graph/
    -p 8080:8080 \
    mfdz/opentripplanner:latest --load --serve graph
```

#### Logback configuration

OTP comes with a default `logback.xml` configuration file which is bundled inside the Jar. In
order to change this, you need to build a new Jar and Docker image, which is cumbersome.

However, it's also possible to define a different `logback.xml` file by using [standard Logback
functionality](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html#configFileProperty).

In order to do this - combined with the automatic download of the graph - follow these steps:

1. Create a file `logback.xml` in the directory where you're running Docker and fill it with the values that you wish.
   A good idea for debugging would be to use a [configuration with colourful log output](https://stackoverflow.com/a/27899234/99022) to ensure that it's working.

2. Run the following command to place the file into the container via a volume and configure the Logback to use it:
```
docker pull mfdz/opentripplanner:latest
docker run --rm -it \
    -v ./logback.xml:/opt/opentripplanner/logback.xml \
    -e JAVA_OPTS="-Dlogback.configurationFile=/opt/opentripplanner/logback.xml" \
    -e GRAPH_ZIP_URL=https://example.com/graph.zip \
    -p 8080:8080 \
    mfdz/opentripplanner:latest
```
3. See that the log output is now using colours.
